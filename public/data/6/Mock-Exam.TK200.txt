you can redirect a code to run a malicious code if you dont have a check on a buffer/array and it will overwrite the value of the buffer.

Lesson 03


8.
RSA is used to agree on a secret to encrypt he data and you need to share the secret. you will use a public/private key infrastructure. RSA is very slow and AES is fast. AES is also secure. Before AES you need to share a secret so you use RSA when you need to communicate with a partner and share the secret with RSA and once the key is shared and you start to use AES that is smarter and faster. 

RSA - can make the key but is slow
AES - can use the key and is fast
